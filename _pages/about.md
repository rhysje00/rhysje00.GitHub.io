I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Mathematics, Physics and Mechanics](http://www.imfm.si/).

My research interests include algebraic graph theory, combinatorics, finite geometry, and related computational aspects.

Previously, I worked at [Sobolev Institute of Mathematics](https://math.nsc.ru/), in the Applied Abstract Algebra group led by Alexander Mednykh. I received my PhD in Mathematics at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/) in 2020, under the supervision of Professor [Leonard H. Soicher](https://webspace.maths.qmul.ac.uk/l.h.soicher/).
